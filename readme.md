# ipod kitty

an endpoint that takes a spotify trackid and redirects to an image
of a cat listening to that song on an ipod.

![ipod kitty](example.png)

this api uses my own canvas api to generate the image so unfortunately you cannot run this locally.

you can however play around with the canvas api at https://canvas.ncp.nathanferns.xyz/playground

it's free
